# agents Specification

## Purpose
The kit's delegation agents in `agents/` and the skills they load, as far as their scope is a promise: `scribe`, `structure-reviewer`, `stack-lens`.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Scribe writes bookkeeping docs from a diff
The kit SHALL ship an agent `scribe` with model `haiku` and effort `low`. It SHALL write a branch's CHANGELOG entry, `openspec/inventory.md` rows and rows of the README's command table from the branch's diff, and SHALL edit no other file or README text.

#### Scenario: New command on a branch
- **WHEN** a branch's diff adds a command and `scribe` runs on it
- **THEN** it adds the CHANGELOG entry, the inventory row and the command-table row
- **AND** `git diff --name-only` for its edits lists only those three files

### Requirement: Scribe hands back explanatory prose
`scribe` SHALL leave prose that describes behaviour unwritten and SHALL list each such item in its report, with the file and section it belongs in.

#### Scenario: Change needs a README paragraph
- **WHEN** a branch's change needs a paragraph explaining new behaviour
- **THEN** `scribe` does not write it and its report lists it under Handed back

### Requirement: Scribe stays out of other agents' work
`scribe` SHALL NOT archive specs, review or verify. The `orchestrate` skill SHALL route these docs to `scribe` in a row that does not overlap its docs row for `implementer`, and `archiver` SHALL stay on `sonnet`.

#### Scenario: Picking an agent for docs
- **WHEN** the orchestrator looks up a README paragraph and a CHANGELOG entry in the `orchestrate` table
- **THEN** the paragraph matches the `implementer` row and the entry matches the `scribe` row

### Requirement: Scribe reaches Copilot
`desk sync` SHALL write `scribe` to `.github/agents/scribe.agent.md` with the other kit agents, with `reasoning-effort: "low"` and its tools mapped, and without a `model` field.

#### Scenario: Sync with the copilot harness
- **WHEN** `desk sync` runs with the `copilot` harness
- **THEN** `.github/agents/scribe.agent.md` exists with that frontmatter

### Requirement: One implementer run per task group
The `orchestrate` skill SHALL tell the orchestrator to start one `implementer` run per code task group, in order, in the same worktree, when a change is expected to change over about 150 lines, and each run SHALL commit before the next starts. A single group SHALL be split first, and a group that cannot pass the check alone SHALL join its neighbour. `scribe` SHALL run after the last run's commit.

#### Scenario: Large change with three code groups
- **WHEN** a change expected to pass 150 lines has three code task groups
- **THEN** the orchestrator runs three `implementer` runs in sequence in one worktree, each ending in a commit

#### Scenario: Large change with one group
- **WHEN** a change expected to pass 150 lines has one task group
- **THEN** the orchestrator splits it into groups before the first run

#### Scenario: Small change with several groups
- **WHEN** a change expected to stay under 150 lines has several task groups
- **THEN** one `implementer` run does them all

### Requirement: Structure reviewer
The kit SHALL ship an agent `structure-reviewer`, model `opus`, effort `high`, with the tools `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Bash` and `Skill` only, that follows the vendored `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` skill on a worktree branch's diff. It SHALL change nothing and SHALL post no board verdict. The `orchestrate` skill SHALL start it as task `review-structure` in parallel with the `reviewer` when a change passes about 150 lines, is a refactor, or pushes a file past 1000 lines, and SHALL merge its blockers into the reviewer's findings for one fix round.

#### Scenario: Large change
- **WHEN** a change of about 400 lines reaches review
- **THEN** the orchestrator starts `reviewer` and `structure-reviewer` in the same message on the same head
- **AND** only the reviewer posts a verdict, so `desk wt merge` gates on it as before

#### Scenario: Small change
- **WHEN** a change of 40 lines that grows no file past 1000 lines reaches review
- **THEN** only the `reviewer` runs

### Requirement: Stack lenses
The kit SHALL ship a `stack-lens` skill whose table maps each lens to one file under `lenses/`, each file with a `## Build` and a `## Review` section. The `implementer` SHALL follow the Build half and the `reviewer` SHALL check the Review half of the lenses its brief names or its files match, reading no other lens. The `orchestrate` skill SHALL name the lenses in every `implementer` and `reviewer` brief.

#### Scenario: TypeScript change with a retry loop
- **WHEN** a brief names the lenses `typescript` and `state`
- **THEN** the agent reads those two lens files and no other
